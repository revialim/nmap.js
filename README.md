This is a javascript implementation of nmap a neighborhood preserving space-filling algorithm for a set of 2D-points. The original nmap algorithm was written by (http://nmap.vicg.icmc.usp.br/){Duante et al.[1]} in (https://github.com/felipelageduarte/NMap){Java}. The code written by the team from SÃ£o Paulo is brilliantly straight forward, so it was quite easy to implement. The training datasets used in the examples were also generated by them.

This implementation also makes use of a slightly modified version of the (http://www.hobsonassoc.com/scripts/closure/goog/docs/class_goog_graphics_AffineTransform.html){AffineTransform} function by Google, originally part of the closure repository. I modified it slightly so that we can include just the function without the rest of the closure library.

Important Notice: This is not a D3 plugin or widget, this is a standalone set of functions that allows you to generate a treemap from a list of 2D points. But as shown in the examples you can then use the returned list of objects to draw the treemap with D3, as shown in the examples.

## How it works

Actually this function combines two ways of computing the treemap: equal weight approach and alternating cut approach. If you want two know more about the differences i suggest you look at their publication (see below) or look at the code.
